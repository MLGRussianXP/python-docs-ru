"Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient "
"high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-"
"oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together "
"with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and "
"rapid application development in many areas on most platforms."

"The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely "
"available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python "
"web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same "
"site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party "
"Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation."

"The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types "
"implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also"
" suitable as an extension language for customizable applications."

"This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and "
"features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python "
"interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-"
"contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well."

"For a description of standard objects and modules, see :ref:`library-index`."
" :ref:`reference-index` gives a more formal definition of the language.  To "
"write extensions in C or C++, read :ref:`extending-index` and :ref:`c-api-"
"index`. There are also several books covering Python in depth."

"This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single "
"feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of"
" Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the "
"language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and "
"write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about"
" the various Python library modules described in :ref:`library-index`."
