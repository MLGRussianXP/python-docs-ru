"Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting "
"Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a "
"successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal "
"author, although it includes many contributions from others."

"In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National "
