"This document describes how to write modules in C or C++ to extend the "
"Python interpreter with new modules.  Those modules can not only define new "
"functions but also new object types and their methods.  The document also "
"describes how to embed the Python interpreter in another application, for "
"use as an extension language.  Finally, it shows how to compile and link "
"extension modules so that they can be loaded dynamically (at run time) into "
"the interpreter, if the underlying operating system supports this feature."

"This document assumes basic knowledge about Python.  For an informal "
"introduction to the language, see :ref:`tutorial-index`.  :ref:`reference-"
"index` gives a more formal definition of the language.  :ref:`library-index`"
" documents the existing object types, functions and modules (both built-in "
"and written in Python) that give the language its wide application range."

"This guide only covers the basic tools for creating extensions provided as "

"This section of the guide covers creating C and C++ extensions without "
"assistance from third party tools. It is intended primarily for creators of "
"those tools, rather than being a recommended way to create your own C "

msgid ""
"Sometimes, rather than creating an extension that runs inside the Python "
"interpreter as the main application, it is desirable to instead embed the "
"CPython runtime inside a larger application. This section covers some of the"
" details involved in doing that successfully."
