"The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern "
"according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned"
" in arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and "
"character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is "
"done by using the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions "
"in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell."

msgid ""
"Note that files beginning with a dot (``.``) can only be matched by patterns"
" that also start with a dot, unlike :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` or "

":func:`os.path.expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"

":file:`../../Tools/\\*/\\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. "
"Broken symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or "
