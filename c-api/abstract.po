"The functions in this chapter interact with Python objects regardless of "
"their type, or with wide classes of object types (e.g. all numerical types, "
"or all sequence types).  When used on object types for which they do not "
"apply, they will raise a Python exception."

":c:func:`PyList_New`, but whose items have not been set to some non-\\ "
