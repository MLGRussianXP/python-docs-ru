"The API below differs from textbook heap algorithms in two aspects: (a) We "

"Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all know "
"that a big sort implies producing \"runs\" (which are pre-sorted sequences, "
"whose size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory), followed by a "
"merging passes for these runs, which merging is often very cleverly "
"organised [#]_. It is very important that the initial sort produces the "
"longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way to achieve that.  If, "
"using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you replace and "
"percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll produce runs "
"which are twice the size of the memory for random input, and much better for"
" input fuzzily ordered."

"Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which may not"
" fit in the current tournament (because the value \"wins\" over the last "

"  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately for progressively "
"building a second heap, which grows at exactly the same rate the first heap "
