"This module provides direct access to all 'built-in' identifiers of Python; "

"This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but "
"can be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-"
"in value, but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.  For "
"example, in a module that wants to implement an :func:`open` function that "
"wraps the built-in :func:`open`, this module can be used directly::"
