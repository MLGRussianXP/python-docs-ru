"``'__main__'`` is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A "
"module's __name__ is set equal to ``'__main__'`` when read from standard "
"input, a script, or from an interactive prompt."

"A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope by "
"checking its own ``__name__``, which allows a common idiom for conditionally"
" executing code in a module when it is run as a script or with ``python -m``"
" but not when it is imported::"

"For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a "
"``__main__.py`` module, the contents of which will be executed when the "
"module is run with ``-m``."
